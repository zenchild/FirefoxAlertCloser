My blog post on this issue:  http://distributed-frostbite.blogspot.com/2010/02/closing-javascript-alerts-in-selenium.html

This is a simple Firefox extension that I use to close unexpected alert boxes while running Selenium tests.  Prior to this the alerts where out of context and Selenium could not control them.  You can see the Selenium-RC FAQ for more information:
http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SRC/Selenium+RC+FAQ

While watching Jason Huggins' presentation on Hacking Selenium ( http://www.infoq.com/presentations/huggins-hacking-selenium ), he demonstrated a way to close the alerts at the browser layer (XUL).  This method was sent to him by Aaron Boodman of Greasemonkey fame.  I (Dan Wanek) have taken the base of Aaron's code and turned it into a simple Firefox extension.  It has worked for me in all of the instances that I have needed it, but if you are having issues you may need to tweak the alertCloser.alertClose method to make it more general use.

Enjoy!


To create the XPI for installation into Firefox simply change to the "FirefoxAlertCloser" directory and zip up the contents.  For example:

git clone git://github.com/zenchild/FirefoxAlertCloser.git
cd FirefoxAlertCloser
zip -r ../alert_closer.xpi . -x ".git/*"

Now just go into Firefox and open the xpi file you created.  I would recommend doing this in a special firefox profile for Selenium testing.
